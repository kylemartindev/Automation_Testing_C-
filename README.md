# Automation_Testing_CSharp:

Created a simple test of a customer journey where you order two products from the automation practise website: http://automationpractice.com/index.php.

Steps included are Login, making the purchases, checking them in the basket, running through the check out and checking the order against the order reference saved to a text file.

This is to highlight my experience with C# .NET/ASP
